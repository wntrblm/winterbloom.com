# Stop Making Synths

Hello friends,

After 5 wonderful years, we've winded down Winterbloom’s operations to make room for new adventures. While this chapter has come to an end, we’re honestly amazed by what we’ve been able to accomplish and the incredible community of musicians and makers that have gathered in our orbit.

When we started Winterbloom our goal was never to make a living off of synthesizers, instead, we wanted to create beautiful, open source instruments and spark inspiration in others. There are so many people in our community who’ve taken up this mantle that it’s impossible for us to see Winterbloom as anything but a smashing success.

We’re excited for our next chapter and grateful for all of the friends we’ve made along the way. 🙂

Thea & Maggie,

## What about support/warranty/repair?

We’ll continue to offer support, including warranty and repair services, indefinitely. Please take a look at our [support resources](./support.md) and reach out to us at [support@winterbloom.com](mailto:support@winterbloom.com) if you need anything.

## What about open source?

All of our modules are and will forever be Open Source Hardware. We not only allow, but encourage others to make our modules themselves. Furthermore, we encourage folks to build on top of our work to create something new.

You can find all of the sources, including hardware designs, software, firmware, and test scripts, on our GitHub at [github.com/wntrblm](https://github.com/wntrblm). Some of our modules even have self-sourcing guides to help you along if you want to do it from scratch.

Finally, if you are a manufacturer and you’re interested in producing our designs or derivatives, please reach out to [thea@winterbloom.com](mailto:support@winterbloom.com). Thea would love to chat about it!

## What about merch?

We'll leave our [Threadless store](./merch.md) open if you want to snag something soft to remember us by.

## Is there any way I can get a module?

Not from us- we're out and we're done! You can try joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UpfqghQ) to see if anyone has one up for grabs or to see if there's any active group buys.

## But why?

We’re ready for something new! While change is hard, we want to take on some new challenges so we can learn new things and explore new possibilities.

## What’s next?

Thea has accepted a position at Opulo, where she’s working on a really cool top secret project. She’ll also continue her work with the Open Source Hardware Association. You can find Thea via her site at https://thea.codes.

Maggie recently completed their degree in Sequential Art and is working as an independent illustrator. They're working on more comic projects and merchandise design. You can follow them on various socials and see more of their work at https://marms.art.

Both of us will continue to work on creative technology projects together, as we’re a pretty damn awesome team. We’ve already got some ideas cooking and we’re excited to get started on them in the new year.
