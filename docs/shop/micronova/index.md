    Our love letter to DIYers is perfect for custom cases.</p>

    <p>Micronova is a miniature <em>100x30mm</em> power supply with a big soul. It
    can provide up to 18W of power for your modules and multiple units can be easily
    daisy chained to power larger systems.</p>

    <p>Despite being adorably small, Micronova provides lots of flexibility for custom
    case builds. It can be powered through an attached DC barrel jack, screw terminals,
    or through an optional <a href="/shop/micronova-front-entry-kit">front entry panel</a>.</p>

    <p>Micronova is equipped with two Eurorack power headers that can be expanded
    using a <a href="/shop/micronova-busboard">busboard</a> or flying bus cable.</p>

    <p>Micronova also has critical safety features including reverse polarity protection,
    a resettable polyfuse, and over-current shutdown.</p>

    <p>A suitable AC-DC power adapter <strong>is required</strong>. We have adapters
    <a href="/shop/power-adapter">available</a> for domestic customers. International
    customers please take a look at the manual for <a href="https://micronova.wntr.dev/#powering-micronova">guidance
    and recommendations</a>.</p>

    <p>Check out the <a href="https://micronova.wntr.dev">manual</a> to get to know
    Micronova and all of the delightful ways you can integrate it into your case.</p>'
