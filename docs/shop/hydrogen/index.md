  description: '<p class="is-callout-text">Precision buffered multiple in 1U format</p>

    <p>Hydrogen is a dual 1-to-4 precision buffered multiple. It works exceptionally
    well with both CV and audio signals and the beautiful blue and red LEDs give you
    immediate feedback on the signals passing through.</p>

    <p>Oh, and when we say <strong>precision</strong>, we mean <strong><em>precision</em></strong>.
    Unlike some other so-called "precision" mults out there, Helium features high-quality,
    low-offset, low-drift op-amps. You''ll have a hard time finding another mult on
    this level.</p>

    <p>The second mult is normalled to the first, so you can operate it as a 1-to-8
    multiple if needed. Need more? Check out Hydrogen''s big sister <a href="/shop/helium">Helium</a>.</p>'
