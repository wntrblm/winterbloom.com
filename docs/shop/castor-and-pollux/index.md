  description: "<p class=\"is-callout-text\">Twins that dance in and out of phase,\
    \ never completely together but never fully apart, bound to each other in the\
    \ infinite universe.</p>\n<p>Castor &amp; Pollux is a dual oscillator that echoes\
    \ back to the legendary Roland Juno but shines with its own unique, massive voice.\
    \ It contains <strong>two</strong> digitally-controlled analog oscillators implemented\
    \ using a faithfully modernized version of the original Juno 106 design. It builds\
    \ on the classic \u201880s sounds of its inspiration by using the second oscillator\
    \ and internal LFO to layer in thick detuned sounds and harmonically complex hard\
    \ synced waveforms.</p>\n<p>Castor &amp; Pollux II brings a redesigned interface\
    \ and moves individual waveform outputs to an included expansion. Both versions\
    \ have the same features and use the same firmware.</p>"
