    \ Honking Button is, well, a big button that honks. Okay- okay, before you run\
    \ away- it\u2019s actually a simple sampler in a very silly package. It has pitch\
    \ CV, gate in, gate out, and you can store up to 8 MB of samples on it. You can\
    \ choose between several button colors and a black or white panel.</p>"
