  description: '<p class="is-callout-text">An embrace from the deep, salty ocean,
    a jetstream of resonance bliss, a chaotic interplanetary voyage to the sounds
    of our most distant world.</p>

    <p>Neptune is a resonant diode ladder filter designed in collaboration with <a
    href="https://www.instagram.com/decapod_devices/">Carson Walls</a>. It''s intended
    to bring together sound and modulation into a complete, distinct synthesizer voice.
    Unlike typical multi-mode filters with separate modes or outputs, Neptune instead
    has separate low-pass and high-pass inputs into a single filter core. It''s coupled
    with a feedback-modulated distortion circuit called <strong>salt</strong> that
    opens up a wide range of tonal possibilities from tame to dirty to outright chaotic.</p>

    <p>Neptune is <strong>not</strong> like its silky-smooth cousins- it''s a wild,
    out of this world filter that exhibits delightfully strange behavior as you push
    its parameters to their limits.</p>'
