The source files for each module are linked at the end of their respective user guides. Additionally, you can find all of the source files on [our GitHub](https://github.com/wntrblm). If you’re having trouble finding what you’re looking for, [reach out](#get-in-touch). Please keep in mind the licenses associated with hardware designs and software, and note that the licenses do not grant permission to use Winterbloom’s name, branding, and logo.

## Returns, warranty, and repairs

Despite shutting down hardware production, we will still honor warranty and repairs indefinitely. If you experience any issues with your module, please [contact us][email]

We will happily accept returns within 30 days for unused items. We’ll generally ask you to pay return shipping. Contact us to get the returns process started.

If you receive a module that does not work, please contact us immediately. Modules purchased from Winterbloom have a warranty of six months from the date of purchase. This warranty covers any manufacturing defects in the module. It does not cover damage from due to incorrect handling, storage, or power, overvoltage events, or modifications.

Modules returned under warranty will either be refunded, replaced, or repaired at our discretion. You will be responsible for the cost of returning the module to Winterbloom.

Because Eurorack has a vast number of possible combinations of power supplies, modules, cases, and accessories, it is impossible for us to guarantee compatibility with every possible configuration. We make a reasonable effort to test modules with several power supplies, cases, and other modules.

We encourage tinkering, however, we will not refund, repair, or replace any products that have been modified.
